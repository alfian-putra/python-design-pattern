# Structural Design Pattern : Flyweight

Flyweight is a structural design pattern that allows programs to support vast quantities of objects by keeping their memory consumption low (refactoring.guru).  

Shared vs. Unique Data: Objects are split into shared (intrinsic) data and unique (extrinsic) data. The shared data is stored in a central place and reused, while the unique data is kept separately.
