# Creational Design Pattern : Builder

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a step-by-step approach to constructing complex objects. It separates the construction process from the object’s representation, enabling the same method to create different variations of an object (geeksforgeeks).

In this example i got the code from geeks for geeks. the concept of this code is :

Computer -> Builder -> GamingComputerBuilder -> ComputerDirector

ComputerDirector take GamingComputer data to construct parameter.
