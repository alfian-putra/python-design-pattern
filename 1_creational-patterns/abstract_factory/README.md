# Creational Design Pattern : Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes (refactoring.guru). Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern except the fact that its more like factory of factories (digitalocean).

The point is : factory of factory.
